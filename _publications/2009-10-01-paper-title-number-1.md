title: "2: Export Slowdown and Parental Investment: Evidence from China's Export Slowdown"
---
This paper sheds lights on how the export slowdown affects the working age manufacturing worker's health status and their children investment behaviors in China
during 2012 and 2016. This paper finds that the export slowdown negatively affects the physical health and mental health outcomes of manufacturing workers. I also
find that this reduced parent’s education investment for their children. And the export slowdown reduced parental’ opinion about the importance of education level to
child's future achievement. As a result, children’s education attainment is reduced due to less parental investment.
