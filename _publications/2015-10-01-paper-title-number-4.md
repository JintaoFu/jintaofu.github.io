This paper sheds lights on how trade liberalization for infants affects long-term health and human capital outcomes 10 years later (i.e., at adolescence). The China's WTO accession brings huge economic benefits but also comes with increasing pollution concentrations. Exploiting the variation source of each prefecture's exposure to trade shock, we document a significant increase in self-rating health status during adolescence. In contrast, the pollution channel induced by trade shock also had significant negative effects on adolescents' math test scores.
