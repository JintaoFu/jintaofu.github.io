This paper evaluates "China's War on Pollution" since 2014 using the legislation of "Key Region Policy" as a quasi-experimental research design. My results show that
this new stringent environmental regulation significantly reduced PM2.5 concentrations. As a result of the reduction of PM2.5 concentrations, I find that the incidence of preterm birth declined. For elderly health, I document a significant reduction in chronic respiratory diseases, pollution-related chronic disease, and medical expenditure. Although there exists pollution exposure difference in occupational categories, I show that manufacturing workers gain larger reduction in chronic respiratory rate from such regulation. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that Key Region Policy brings substantial benefits, which are valued at about $21.3 billion for the year 2017.
